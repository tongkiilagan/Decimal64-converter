  ## How to use: 
  
  1. Launch the application and select ```Base 10``` button on the left hand side.
  2. Fill in the necessary fields for the mantissa and exponent. If the input for the mantissa is too long and a rounding method is not selected, the ```Calculate``` button will not let you continue unless you select one.
  3. The Rounded/Normalized output is right above the binary output once you have pressed the ```Calculate```. The binary output is calculated by default, but the ```hex``` button will allow you to view the hexadecimal answer, and vice versa with the ```binary``` button. 
  4. ```Save to text``` will allow you to write the currently displayed answer output (in binary/hexadecimal) depending on what output format you selected. It will get saved to ```Output.txt```. If you want to save the answer again, kindly press either the ```hex``` or ```binary``` button again and you will be able to add more entries to the same text file.
  5. Once you are done with viewing the calculation, pressing ```Base 10``` button at the side will prompt you to enter new values again.
